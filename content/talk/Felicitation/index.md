# summary: On the annual celebration of Republic Day in India, I was honored with the Socio-Technical Research Award by the director of VNIT for my efforts in creating the Sahayak Robot in response to the COVID-19 crisis.
abstract: During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying lockdown, I converted a hospital trolley into a remotely controlled automated robot. The robot was designed to safely deliver food and medication to COVID-19 patients. It also had a display screen, camera, and speaker, which allowed doctors to communicate with patients via video. The robot was tested at AIIMS Nagpur and received a lot of attention on social media due to its rapid development in just nine days. I not only recieved recognition for this work but also got funding from the Alumini Association of VNIT for further development of Sahayak.
