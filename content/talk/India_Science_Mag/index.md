summary: I was interviewd by the India Science Magazine with regard to the Sahayak Robot which was developed to aid doctors and nurses in treating COVID affected patients.
abstract: In the difficlut times of lockdown when the pandemic was at its peak, I converted a hospital trolley into an automated robot that can be wirelessly controlled. Such a robot can be used by the hospital staff to deliver food packets and medicines to the Covid-19 patients and maintain a safe distance. The robot is also equipped with a display screen, camera, and a speaker which can be used by the doctors for video communication with the patients. The robot is being currently tested at AIIMS Nagpur to serve coronavirus patients. This was achieved in a span of just 9 days and hence gained a lot of attention on the social media. This interview is on the same lines about how the idea originated and the way we actually made it happen.
