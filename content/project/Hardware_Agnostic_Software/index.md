title: GHAR - General Hardware Agnostic Robot software
summary: As robotics researchers develop new algorithms (i.e, a control algorithm), they dedicate a significant amount of time to implementing and testing the algorithm on a specific platform. A key task of performing tests lies in the development of the full software stack for the specified platform, thus leading to a longer implementation and testing time. Using a general, extensible, and modular software stack will allow researchers to swiftly implement their algorithm and perform tests efficiently. This calls for the General Hardware Agnostic Robot (GHAR) Software.
