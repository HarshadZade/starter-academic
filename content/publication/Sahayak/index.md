abstract: During this COVID-19 pandemic, the need to reduce person-to-person contact in hospitals and quarantine facilities has increased exponentially. Developing an autonomous robot for hospital environments is a potential solution aiming to reduce the risk of infection. This work proposes a general framework for developing medical assistive robots capable of delivering food and medicine to patients and facilitating teleconferencing with doctors. The ideas presented here have been validated extensively in simulated environments employing a Navigation Stack for autonomous mobility, while a teleoperated prototype was deployed at AIIMS Nagpur, India.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We present the design of an autonomously navigating robot that can be deployed at hospitals to reduce the contact between healthcare workers and their patients. Future works will involve provisions for Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance and solutions for the Global Localization problem.
