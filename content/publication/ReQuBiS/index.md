abstract: The selection of mobility modes for robot navigation consists of various trade-offs. Snake robots are ideal for traversing through constrained environments such as pipes, cluttered and rough terrain, whereas bipedal robots are more suited for structured environments such as stairs. Finally, quadruped robots are more stable than bipeds and can carry larger payloads than snakes and bipeds but struggle to navigate soft soil, sand, ice, and constrained environments. A reconfigurable robot can achieve the best of all worlds. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art reconfigurable robots rely on the rearrangement of modules through complicated mechanisms to dissemble and assemble at different places, increasing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements. We propose Reconfigurable Quadrupedal-Bipedal Snake Robots (ReQuBiS), which can transform between mobility modes without rearranging modules. Hence, requiring just a single modification mechanism. Furthermore, our design allows the robot to split into two agents to perform tasks in parallel for biped and snake mobility. Experimental results demonstrate these mobility capabilities in snake, quadruped, and biped modes and transitions between them.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: Self-assembling and self-reconfiguring robots have the ability to adapt to different or varying environments and carry out complex tasks. Robots competent of performing serpentine gaits and transforming into legged systems impart a wide range of locomotion schemes. Most of the reconfigurable robotic solutions consist of a large number of complicated mechanisms to detach and re-attach at different places making the system fragile and increase its size, weight and power (SWaP). We propose Reconfigurable Quadrupedal-Bipedal Snake Robots (ReQuBiS) to easily transform into these forms. Experimental results demonstrate the mobility in snake, quadruped and biped modes and transition between them with minimal change in modules.
