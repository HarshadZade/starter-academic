Robotics has always fascinated me, especially electronics and hardware design. It is my hobby to develop and implement new ideas. I aim to contribute to this domain through research and continuous practice.

I have been working on embedded systems under [Dr. Shital Chiddarwar](http://mec.vnit.ac.in/people/sschiddarwar/) at [IvLabs](http://www.ivlabs.in/) since my sophomore. My newly found interest is in Bio-inspired Robotics in general and Snake robots particularly.

Apart from robotics, I like playing cricket, listening to music and playing tabla. I also spend some in conducting workshops for the freshmen to promote a technical culture in the college.
