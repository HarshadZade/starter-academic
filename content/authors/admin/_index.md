I aspire to become a full-stack roboticist to create multi-tasking robots that adapt to new environments and positively impact people's everyday lives at homes and workplaces. I am particularly interested in tackling the challenges of deploying bio-inspired robots in the field and work towards a socially significant problem. In the long term, I hope to start my own company that uses field robotics to provide solutions to real-world problems such as search and rescue missions in complex environments. 

<!-- How many robots do we see being used in the real world today? It is safe to say that robots have practically taken over the manufacturing and industrial sector, but deploying robots that could meaningfully collaborate with humans in unknown environments remains a challenge. In my opinion, the gap lies in the complex interplay between the software algorithms, which include perception, planning, controls, and the hardware.  -->

While completing my undergraduate degree, I worked with [Dr. Shital Chiddarwar](http://mec.vnit.ac.in/people/sschiddarwar/) at [IvLabs, the AI and Robotics Lab ](http://www.ivlabs.in/), on a variety of projects focused on creating innovative and robust hardware platforms. In addition to this work, I also led workshops for first-year students to foster a technical culture at my college.


Outside of work, I am a sports enthusiast and love adventure. I also enjoy listening to music and play tabla. On weekends I go running and biking, plan hikes, road trips, and organizes board game sessions and surprise people with my culinary skills!
<!-- Apart from robotics, I play cricket, listen to music and play tabla.  -->
